### Fried Chicken, with mashed potatoes and gravy.
I know that is more of a **meal**, rather than a single dish, but so is pizza. Fried Chicken is great on its own, but without the mashed potatoes and chicken gravy, it isn't the __same__. But if you are going to make this, then you need to make a **side**. Winter is green bean cassarole, and in summer corn on the cob.
