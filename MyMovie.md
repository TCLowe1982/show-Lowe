You had to ask me my favorite movie, didn't you? And I assume you only want one movie.
I have a literal ton of movies I love, but I'm going to go with Star Wars. And by Star Wars,
I mean A New Hope, Episode IV. If you haven't seen it, stop grading this right now, and go 
watch it. If you were one of a handful of people who haven't seen Star Wars, then you now
understand why I love this movie. It's wonderfully paced, with a beautiful world building, and
some of the best characters ever commited to film. I could literally talk about Star Wars all
day, and sometimes do with my wife, who also loves Star Wars.![The main three](Carrie-Fisher-3-0504-ed5e3c79874640ff90a8c8a56d7b6627.webp)
